<p style="position: relative; Left: 3%;width: 97%;"><big> Translation practice is as old as the history of humanity. It has had a crucial role in communication between different cultures and languages, especially in economic, political, social, and cultural operations. Thus, translators and linguists conduct vital duties as they make the necessary interactions possible. 
	<br> <br>  
Language is proof of humanity’s existence as people communicate through it and leave marks on the earth. For this reason, it causes chaos when there is no language unity. The translation practice is critical to keep up with the times, follow the latest developments, and maintain communication. Therefore, it takes a position that mediates between different societies to understand each other economically, politically, culturally, and socially. Translators here function as intermediaries. 
<br> <br>
Translators can be seen as cultural transmitters, mediating between cultures through providing both oral and written translation. Consequently, the workload of translators, as language experts responsible for the task, is quite heavy. </big></p>
